        h3 Aesthetic Measurement of Paintings
       
        p
          | This talk will first introduce the recently emerging interdisciplinary research topics of 
          | computational aesthetics and aesthetic computing, and discuss their difference and 
          | complementary roles. We will then focus on computational aesthetics, in particular, on the
          | aesthetic measurement of paintings. Based on the mathematician Birkhoff's 1933 seminal 
          | theory of aesthetic measurement, we measure the white space usage in Master Wu Guanzhong's
          | paintings, and the complexity of Chinese ink paintings. We then report our latest work on
          | the visual order of both Chinese ink paintings and Western styled oil paintings and compare
          | their commonality and differences, possibly influenced by different cultural backgrounds. 
          | If time permits, we will mention our recent efforts in generating abstract images of styles
          | of Kandinsky, Miro, Pollock, and Picasso, and floor plan generation.

    //-     p 
    //-       | Design studies are a popular approach to problem-driven research in the field of visualization.
    //-       | I define a design study as a situation where visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts,
    //-       | design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design,
    //-       | and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines.
    //-       | I will discuss the methodology of conducting these studies and processes to help researchers and practitioners avoid potential pitfalls.
    //-       | For example, one consideration for success in such projects is ensuring that the collaboration incentives are aligned for all parties.
    //-       | I will illustrate the potential and challenges of design studies through case studies in three application domains:
    //-       | conducting facilities management and planning with building occupancy data, analyzing consumer behaviour with e-commerce clickstream data,
    //-       | and investigating biological hypotheses through the relationships between many evolutionary trees for both species and genes.
