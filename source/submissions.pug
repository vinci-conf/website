        p
          | Submissions that address research and development, as well as experience reports
          | and tool demonstrations on the above and other related topics are strongly encouraged.
          | Papers can be submitted as full papers, short papers and posters. Each submitted
          | symposium paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three International Program Committee
          | members. You are welcome to submit a paper to VINCI 2020. All accepted papers and posters
          | will appear in the proceedings of VINCI 2020 published by ACM Press and made available in the
          | #[a(href="http://dl.acm.org/") ACM Digital Library] (EI indexed). Moreover, authors of a number of selected full papers of
          | high quality will be invited to prepare revised versions of their work for submission to a
          | special issue of the #[a(href="https://vciba.springeropen.com/") Journal of Visual Computing for Industry, Biomedicine, and Art], and a
          | special issue of the #[a(href="https://link.springer.com/journal/12650") Journal of Visualization] (SCI indexed).
        
        p
          | Research papers and experience reports of up to eight (8), short papers of up to
          | four (4), and tool demonstrations or posters of up to two (2) ACM double-column
          | pages should be submitted through #[a(href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vinci2021") easychair.org]. The review process will be single-blind.
          | We appreciate the submission of videos or other supplemental material. Please provide
          | a URL at the end of the submitted paper to enable the reviewers the download of your
          | additional material. Detailed information on the electronic submission can be found at
          | the end of this page.

        p
          | All submissions (regular papers, proposals of workshops/tutorial/etc) must be formatted
          | using the #[a(href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template") ACM Proceedings Template] (using sigconf format/template) and should consist
          | of one single PDF file (please note: the authors of accepted papers will be later requested
          | to submit source Latex or Word files during camera-ready version submission). The maximum
          | length of each symposium paper is defined as follows.

        ul.list
          li.list-item Full paper: up to eight (8) pages (including references)
          li.list-item Short paper: up to four (4) pages (additional 1 page only for references is allowed)

        p
          | VINCI '21 is also soliciting proposals for full-day or half-day workshops and tutorials
          | on topics that address areas of interest to the community. Proposals should not be
          | longer than a maximum of 2 pages. In particular, workshop proposals should include:

        ul.list
          li.list-item The title and a brief description of the specific issues that the workshop will address, the reasons why the workshop is of interest in these times, and the main research areas involved.
          li.list-item Contact information of the workshop chairs, their competence in the proposed topic(s) and previous experience in chairing scientific events.
          li.list-item A tentative list of program committee members.
          li.list-item Intended length (half or full day) and a draft of the Call for Papers.
          li.list-item It is expected that the workshop organizers will setup an own workshop web page as soon as the workshop proposal has been accepted.

        p
          | Tutorials usually attract a broad range of audiences, including professionals, researchers,
          | students, or practitioners, who wish to enhance their knowledge in the specific tutorial topic.
          | Tutorials offer a unique opportunity to disseminate in-depth information on specific topics
          | in visual information communication and interaction. Tutorial proposals should include short
          | biographies of the proposers, a draft of the tutorial content, intended length, and evidence
          | of the possibility of attracting audience to the tutorial.

        p
          | It is possible to extend the symposium by one day in case many workshops or tutorials are
          | proposed and accepted.

        p
          | Workshop / Tutorial / Special Session / Panel proposals should be sent via email to
          | #[a(href="mailto:proposals@vinci-conf.org?subject=VINCI 2021 - (Workshop/Tutorial/Session/Panel) Proposal Submission") proposals@vinci-conf.org]. Please add the concrete proposal type to the subject line.
