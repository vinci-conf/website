        p #[strong Research Papers:] A research paper describes a new algorithm, technique, system, or theory that have not previously appeared in the literature, or that significantly extended. The description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent/qualified graduate student in visualization could implement or apply the work and should provide an formal/informal evaluation and discussion regarding its strengths and weaknesses.
        
        p #[strong Experience Papers:] An Experience paper reports on experience made during the applications of existing algorithms, techniques, systems, or theories as possibly alternative approaches to already researched  problems in visual communication and interaction. This includes a description of a problem domain, data sets, the questions to be addressed, and describes the application to the task.

        p #[strong Tooling/Demonstration Papers:] Papers in this category, apply existing and well known algorithms, techniques, or systems for visual communication and interaction in new application fields/domains or demonstrate specific technical aspects as well as customized software solutions. Submissions should address what will be learned from the demonstration.

          | Submissions that address research and development, and experience reports
          | on the above topics are strongly encouraged.
          | Papers can be submitted as full papers, short papers, and posters. 
          | Each submitted symposium paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three International Program Committee members. 
          | You are welcome to submit a paper to #{conference.short} #{conference.year}. 
          | All accepted papers and posters will appear in the proceedings of #{conference.short} #{conference.year} published by ACM ICPS and made available in the #[a(href="http://dl.acm.org/") ACM Digital Library] (EI indexed). 
          | Moreover, authors of a number of selected full papers of high quality will be invited to prepare revised versions of their work for submission to a special issue of the #[a(href="https://link.springer.com/journal/12650") Journal of Visualization] (SCI indexed) and a special issue of the #[a(href="https://vciba.springeropen.com/") Journal of Visual Computing for Industry, Biomedicine, and Art].
