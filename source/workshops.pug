        h3 2nd Youth Academic Workshop on Visual Information Communication
        p 
          | The rapid development of the field of data science creates many new ideas, concepts, technologies, from machine and deep learning, clustering, data mining, knowledge extraction, but also more visualization-related topics like visual analytics, information and software visualization, AR, VR, MR, immersive analytics, as well as explainable AI or human-computer interaction.
        p 
          | To offer an opportunity for young researchers in these fields we organize the 2nd Youth Academic Workshop on Visual Information Communication to attract submissions from bachelor and master students. 
          | The papers must be submitted as short papers (4 pages written in English) in our VINCI conference paper format. 
          | The submission deadline is #[strong April 15th, 2022], the same as for the short and full papers. 
          | The papers will be peer-reviewed and in case of acceptance published in the ACM VINCI proceedings as short papers. 
          | The students of accepted papers can register for the conference at a reduced registration fee of only 100 Euros.

    //-     h3 Workshop on Visual Communication in and for the Industry
    //-     p 
    //-       | The industry produces a wealth of data sources in our modern days, demanding for advanced techniques and technologies from the fields of computer and data science, visual analytics, and human-computer interaction in combination. 
    //-       | In particular, aspects from interactive visualizations are crucial ingredients in this whole data exploration process to visually communicate the results of a data analysis. 
    //-       | Although the field has progressed a lot in the past, there are still lots of challenges worth discussing which mostly hinder the use, application, or acceptance of visualizations in industry as a way to communicate between researchers and industrial partners in a collaborative and cooperative way. 
    //-       | The goal of this workshop is to build a community to discuss such issues and to try to find solutions that help to prevent such issues in the future.

    //-     h3 Workshop on 3D Interaction for Visual Communication
    //-     p 
    //-       | Today's visualizations are generally expected to provide some degree of interactivity. 
    //-       | Interaction is the key ingredient that enables exploration of otherwise static images and is a driving force for advances in real-time computer graphics as well. 
    //-       | The combination of interaction and real-time rendering has fundamentally changed the understanding of visual information communication.

    //-     p 
    //-       | For several decades we have become familiar with 2D user interfaces and with it, 2D visualizations and interactions. 
    //-       | With recent advances in, e.g., GPUs and touch-based devices, minification of sensors, gaze-tracking, gesture-detection, and many more, we have been introduced to more advanced, yet more complicated, metaphors for 3D interactions (e.g., navigating in 3D cartography or walking immersive VR environments).

    //-     p 
    //-       | This allowed for many immersive and powerful applications, but also increased the number of possibilities for and complexity of 3D interactions for visual communication. With a dedicated focus on 3D, this workshop aims to explore state-of-the-art, to investigate current challenges and potential solutions, to identify new research questions, and to give a perspective on interesting use cases. 
        
    //-     h3 The relevant topics for this workshop are:
